# Infinity Blade Save Dumper
 
The Infinity Blade Save Dumper tool aims to turn Serialized Infinity Blade Save Packages into a readable Json format so the user can make highly customizable changes. The Dumper also has a feature that re-calculates and serializes your de-serialized save, making it fast and easy to change and import into your game.

Im aiming to have support for all 4 ChAIR games by the time this is finished, and am currently in the midst of completely rewriting my codebase from the ground up as of March 27, 2025.
