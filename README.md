# Infinity Blade Save Dumper

**IBSaveDumper** is a simple tool for handling save file packages for the Infinity Blade Trilogy. It allows you to extract, modify, and repackage save data with ease.

## Features
- **Simple interface**: Drag-and-drop support for `.bin` and `.json` files.  
- **Encrypted save support**: Recognizes and decrypts encrypted save packages.  
- **Deserialize saves**: Converts `.bin` save files into readable `.json` files.  
- **Repackage saves**: Recalculates and repackages the deserialized file back into its original format.

## How it Works
1. Drag and drop a `.bin` save file into the program.
2. The program exports the save data as a `.json` file in the `OUTPUT` folder.
3. Modify the `.json` file as needed.
4. Drag and drop the modified `.json` file into the program.
5. The program transforms your modified data back into the original save format.
