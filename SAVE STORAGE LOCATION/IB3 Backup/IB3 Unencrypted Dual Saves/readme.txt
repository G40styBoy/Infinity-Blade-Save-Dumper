In order to import these save files, you will need the SaveTransfer.json modded into the IB3 IPA (courtesy of G40sty). The easiest way to get this is the pre-built Megamod IPA, which is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/19dE5XttKoi0COIMjAWNxT1M5_6_a66h8/view?usp=drive_link.

Fights have all been set up to use dual weapons with maximum damage (just keep swiping according to the bonus combo pattern on the weapon). The fight will assume that you will not cast magic (although you have the option for MCD, which is a necessity for some fights) and you will not get hit (I think you'll just die anyways). I have equipped a Titan Break +2 hexagon gem in the ring, which you can swap out for a Perfect Parry Stun hexagon gem if you'd like. Fights are set up for 5:1, but stats should be easy to reset for higher ratio fights.

Steps to import:
NOTE: Importing a save file will overwrite your current save. Make sure to backup any progress before using the AFC file. AFC files are NOT valid for entering into the leaderboard, they are only valid for AFC fights.
1. Download the UnencryptedSave0.bin that you wish to import. Do NOT rename the file.
2. Place the UnencryptedSave0.bin into your IB3 folder (at the same level as SAVE, in 3uTools) or in your Files (Browse > On My iPhone > Infinity Blade 3).
3. In game, go to Inventory > Gear (Upper Right) > Options, scroll to the bottom and select "Import Save Slot 0".

You're all set! If you have any questions or notice anything wrong with the saves, feel free to ping me (Bu / SibuTV) and I'll do my best to help.
